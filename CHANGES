Edits to expand range of reconstruction parameters correctly handled -
Edits to Utils.pm (now version 0.14).

Corrected handling of transposition coding, moved from hash into
function.  Added routine to allow default value if given parameter
value not defined. Corrected bug in transformation matrix code to use
ACQ_fov instead of RECO_fov to calculate voxel sizes (these are
usually the same).  

Added fairly comprehensive help docs via pod, pod2usage.

Version 0.55  3 Feb 03
----------------------

Option for using configuration files added using Getopt:ArgvFile.
Getopt::ArgvFile now needed as part of install.

File suffix / protocol name matches moved from code into configuration
file, and can now be passed as command line argument.  Example
configuration file provided with archive.

Changed default behaviour from converting first series to converting
all images in directory.

Added option to omit subject information from info saved in brkhdr
text file, and made this the default.

Searchpaths for Bruker data can be passed in configuration files or
command line args, allowing default data directories to be specified.
If the subject number passed as input to pvconv.pl does not have an
extension, the program does a wildcard search through the directories
in the searchpath, for directories matching "<passed subject no>*".

Moved session number find into Bruker/Utils.pm, now version 0.16

Fixed bugs in handling of second argument on command line, added
warning that this usage is deprecated.

Many updates to help documentation.

Pvshow extensively updated to use new routines in Bruker::Utils,
option files, and its own pod documentation. Config file with archive.
