pvconv	
------

pvconv is a converter for Bruker format MRI image data.  It contains
some programs including the converter, and libraries supporting reads
of Bruker data and handling of Analyze and matlab format files.

See html documentation at http://pvconv.sourceforge.net.

PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version 5.
Some modules within this package depend on other packages that are
distributed separately from Perl.  We will need the following packages
installed before you install pvconv:

	Math-Matrix
	Getopt-ArgvFile

These packages should be available on CPAN (see below).

INSTALLATION

You install pvconv using the normal perl module distribution drill:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of pvconv in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

This will put all the library modules in ~/perl/lib, and the scripts
in ~/perl/bin.  If you want to be more tricky you could try something
like:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl INSTALLBIN=~/bin

will put the libraries into ~/perl/lib, and the scripts into ~/bin.

The Makefile.PL program will start out by checking your perl
installation for a few packages that are recommended to be installed
together with pvconv.

DOCUMENTATION

There is html documentation at http://pvconv.sourceforge.net.  Also,
see the pod documentation in pvconv.pl for an overview of the
program. See ./CHANGES for recent changes.

POD style documentation is included in the scripts pvconv.pl and
pvshow.pl.  These are normally converted to manual pages and installed
as part of the "make install" process.  You should also be able to use
the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read documentation from the files
directly.

LINKS

The example Bruker data text files report themselves as being in JCAMP-DX
format. For information on this format, see:

    http://jcamp-dx.org/

In particular, the example files say they are in JCAMP-DX 4.24 format.  The
reference for this format appears to be:
